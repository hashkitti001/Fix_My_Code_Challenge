## Fix My Code Challenge: README.md

**Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge!**

This is a fun and optional project designed to enhance debugging skills. We'll provide you with existing code snippets in various languages, and your task is to identify and fix the issues to make them work as intended.



**Tasks:**

The challenge consists of four sub-challenges focusing on different functionalities and programming languages:

1. **FizzBuzz (Python):** Fix the provided Python code to correctly implement the FizzBuzz logic (divisible by 3 = "Fizz", divisible by 5 = "Buzz", divisible by both = "FizzBuzz").
2. **Print Square (JavaScript):** Fix the JavaScript code to print a square of the desired size using hash characters (#).
3. **Sort Arguments (Ruby):** Fix the Ruby code to sort a list of arguments passed to the script in ascending order.
4. **User Password (Python):** Fix the Python code for a `User` class, ensuring the `is_valid_password` method correctly validates the password.
5. **Double Linked List (C):** Fix the C code for a double linked list, ensuring the `delete_dnodeint` function removes nodes at the specified index as intended.
